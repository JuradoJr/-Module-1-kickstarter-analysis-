I recommend Louise to:
1) Keep her goals around the average of 4,000 to 5,000 Euro mark to increase her chances of having a successful campaign.
2) And to get her play produced for for less than 4,000 Euros.
3) Campaign in May and June, due to those months having the highest success rates.
4) Try to focus on theater(plays)/music due to those having highest success rates.
